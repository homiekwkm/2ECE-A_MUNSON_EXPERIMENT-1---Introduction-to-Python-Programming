Alphabet Soup Problem

#Define the function
def alphabet_soup(word):
    #Sort the letters of an inputted word
    sort_letters = sorted(word)

    #Join together the letters after sorting
    sorted_word = ''.join(sort_letters)
    
    return sorted_word

#Sample output:
result = alphabet_soup("Skibidi123")
print(result) 
#Output should be: "123Sbdiiik" (Sort is based on ASCII; numbers first, then uppercase letters, and then lowercase letters.)

Emoticon Problem
#Define the function
def emotify(sentence):
    #Create a library that maps words to emoticons
    emotify_words = {
        "smile": ":)",
        "grin": ":D",
        "sad": ":((",
        "mad": ">:("
    }

    #Split sentence in order to let the function be able to swap a specific word in a sentence
    words = sentence.split()

    #Emotify the words
    emotified_words = [emotify_words.get(word, word) for word in words]

    #Join together the words along with the emoticons into a sentence
    emotified_sentence = ' '.join(emotified_words)

    return emotified_sentence

#Sample output:
result = emotify("I wish I could smile at you and see you grin back at me again. I feel sad when I think about it, then I go mad remembering our days together.")
print(result)

#Output should be: "I wish I could :) at you and see you :D back at me again. I feel :(( when I think about it, then I go >:( remembering our days together."



Unpacking List Problem
#Make list of numbers
numbers_on_the_board = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

#Assign elements to variables to unpack
first = (numbers_on_the_board[0])
middle = (numbers_on_the_board[1:5])
last = (numbers_on_the_board[-1])


#Print variables
print(first)
print(middle)
print(last)

#Output should be:
#print(first) = 1
#print(middle) = [2, 3, 4, 5]
#print(last) = 6
